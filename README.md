# Next.js Web App

This is a web application built with Next.js that fetches data from a JSON file using Redux. The app provides a user interface for displaying a collection of series and movies. It includes various features and functionalities to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Data Filtering and Sorting:** The app filters the entries based on the release year attribute, only displaying those with a value greater than or equal to 2010. The filtered entries are sorted in ascending alphanumeric order based on the title attribute.

- **Pagination:** The app includes pagination to display a limited number of entries per page, improving performance and user experience.

- **Hover Animations:** On hover, the app provides an image zoom effect for enhanced visibility. The card box border color changes, providing a visual cue to the user.
